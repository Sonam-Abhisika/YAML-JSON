# This is my 1st YAML
# I am very much excited to learn more on YAML
# I am working with YAML with VS Code

NOTES with Examples:

# YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
    # It is a superset of JSON
    # lists begin with a hyphen
    # dependent on whitespace / indentation
    # better suited for configuration than json

# It is just like XML and JSON but better than both of them
# It is very light weight and easy to use, uses less syntax
# Features: Supports Cross platforms, better than JSON
# YAML is like any other

# YAML only supports "Key-value pair" combination only for single entity/object.
# User can provide the "space in Name of Key".
# User can use the "Single or Double Quotes" in Key Name.
# "Key can't be repeated" within the same space in YAML.

# Indentation of WhiteSpace used to denote structure. This is similar to python. 
# basic structure of YAML is Map (just like in Java) or may call it Dictionary (just like and python), hash depending on your favourite programming language. 
# YAML is "case sensitive". (name=levelup360 != Name=levelup360)
